# Hello — I'm Suki

Welcome to my simple Jekyll GitHub Pages site. This page is written in Markdown so it is easy to edit — just modify `index.md` in the repository.

A few quick links and notes:

- About me — add a short paragraph here about yourself.
- Projects — list your projects with links below.
- Contact — add an email or social links.

## Example content you can edit

I’m Suki — a short introduction goes here. Replace this text with your own bio, links, or whatever you want on your homepage.

### Projects

- Project One — link or short description
- Project Two — link or short description

### Contact

- Email: yourname@example.com
- GitHub: [sukiuppal](https://github.com/sukiuppal)
